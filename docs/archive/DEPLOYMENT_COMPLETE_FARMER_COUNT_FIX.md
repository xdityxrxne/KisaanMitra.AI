# ✅ Deployment Complete: Farmer Count Query Fix

**Deployed**: March 1, 2026 at 15:49 IST  
**Lambda Function**: whatsapp-llama-bot  
**Region**: ap-south-1 (Mumbai)  
**Status**: ✅ Active

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem
When you asked "How many farmers are in my village", the system responded:
> "I couldn't find any OTHER farmers matching your criteria in the knowledge graph."

This was confusing because there ARE 15 farmers in Kolhapur (including you).

### Solution Deployed
✅ **Smart Query Detection**: AI now distinguishes between "total count" vs "other farmers" queries  
✅ **Correct Count**: Shows 15 total farmers (you + 14 others)  
✅ **User Profile First**: Your profile is shown first in total count queries  
✅ **Better Formatting**: Clear, professional response format  
✅ **Bilingual Support**: Works in both English and Hindi

## 🔍 What Changed in the Code

### 1. Enhanced Query Detection
**File**: `lambda_whatsapp_kisaanmitra.py`

**Before**:
```python
kg_check_prompt = """Is this asking about OTHER FARMERS..."""
```

**After**:
```python
kg_check_prompt = """Is this asking about FARMERS..."""
count_prompt = """Is this asking for TOTAL/ALL farmers or just OTHER farmers?"""
```

### 2. Updated get_village_farmers()
**File**: `knowledge_graph_helper.py`

**New Parameters**:
- `include_self`: Whether to include user in results
- Returns: `(farmers, current_user)` tuple

### 3. Enhanced format_farmers_list()
**File**: `knowledge_graph_helper.py`

**New Parameters**:
- `current_user`: User object to display
- `query_type`: 'all' or 'other'

**New Behavior**:
- Shows total count when `query_type='all'`
- Displays user profile first
- Lists other farmers below

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If response still shows "OTHER farmers"
1. Check CloudWatch logs for errors
2. Verify knowledge graph data was included in deployment
3. Check if user profile exists in DynamoDB

### If no farmers found
1. Verify demo data file was included: `demo/knowledge_graph_dummy_data.json`
2. Check Lambda logs for file loading errors
3. Verify user's village matches data (should be "Kolhapur")

### If Lambda errors
1. Check CloudWatch logs: `/aws/lambda/whatsapp-llama-bot`
2. Verify all dependencies were included in zip
3. Check IAM permissions for DynamoDB access
