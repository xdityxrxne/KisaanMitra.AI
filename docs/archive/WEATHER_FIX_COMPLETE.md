# Weather Feature Fix Complete ✅

**Date**: February 28, 2026  
**Status**: DEPLOYED

---

## Problem Summary

The weather feature had two issues:

1. **API Key Not Working**: Weather service was using MOCK data despite API key being set
2. **Intent Detection Missing**: When user typed "Weather in Nashik" as a new message (not in response to weather prompt), it wasn't recognized as a weather query

---

## Updates

### Update 1: Smart Location Detection from Profile ✅

**New Feature**: When user clicks the weather button, the system now automatically fetches their location from their onboarding profile!

**How it works:**
1. User clicks "🌤️ Weather Forecast" button
2. System checks user's profile in DynamoDB (`kisaanmitra-farmer-profiles` table)
3. If `village` field exists → Automatically shows weather for that location
4. If no village in profile → Asks user to type city name

**Benefits:**
- One-click weather (no need to type city every time)
- Personalized experience
- Faster interaction

**Code Location**: `src/lambda/lambda_whatsapp_kisaanmitra.py` - Weather button handler

```python
elif list_id == "weather":
    # Get user's location from profile, or ask if not available
    user_lang = get_user_language(from_number)
    
    # Try to get user's village from profile
    user_location = None
    if ONBOARDING_AVAILABLE:
        try:
            from onboarding.farmer_onboarding import onboarding_manager
            profile = onboarding_manager.get_user_profile(from_number)
            if profile and profile.get('village'):
                user_location = profile.get('village')
                print(f"[WEATHER] Using profile location: {user_location}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[WEATHER] Could not fetch profile: {e}")
    
    # If we have user's location, show weather directly
    if user_location and WEATHER_AVAILABLE:
        try:
            weather = get_weather_forecast(user_location)
            weather_analysis = analyze_weather_for_farming(weather)
            reply = format_weather_response(user_location, weather_analysis)
            send_whatsapp_message(from_number, reply)
            return {'statusCode': 200, 'body': 'ok'}
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[WEATHER ERROR] {e}")
            # Fall through to ask for location
    
    # If no location in profile, ask user
    # ... (rest of code)
```

## Root Causes

### Issue 1: Mock Data Being Used
- The `get_weather_forecast()` function was checking for API key but not logging enough details
- The API call was timing out at 3 seconds (too short)
- Location name wasn't being cleaned (e.g., "weather in Nashik" should be "Nashik")

### Issue 2: Weather Intent Not Detected
- When user clicked weather button → System asked for city → User replied "Pune" → Worked ✅
- But when user typed "Weather in Nashik" as a new message → Routed to general agent → AI said "I don't have weather data" ❌
- The general agent didn't check for weather keywords

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Improved Weather API Call

**File**: `src/lambda/weather_service.py`

Changes:
1. Added detailed logging to show API key status
2. Increased timeout from 3s to 5s
3. Added location name cleaning (removes "weather in", "weather", etc.)
4. Added better error handling with full traceback

```python
def get_weather_forecast(location):
    """Get weather forecast from OpenWeather API"""
    api_key = os.environ.get('OPENWEATHER_API_KEY')
    
    print(f"[WEATHER] API key present: {bool(api_key)}, Length: {len(api_key) if api_key else 0}")
    
    if not api_key or api_key == 'not_available' or len(api_key) < 10:
        print("[WEATHER] API key not available, using mock data")
        return get_mock_weather(location)
    
    try:
        # Clean location name (remove extra words like "weather in")
        location_clean = location.lower().replace('weather in', '').replace('weather', '').strip()
        if not location_clean:
            location_clean = location
        
        print(f"[WEATHER] Fetching weather for: {location_clean}")
        url = f"https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q={location_clean},IN&appid={api_key}&units=metric"
        response = http.request('GET', url, timeout=5.0)
        
        print(f"[WEATHER] API response status: {response.status}")
        
        if response.status == 200:
            data = json.loads(response.data)
            print(f"[WEATHER] ✅ Real weather data fetched successfully")
            return data
        else:
            print(f"[WEATHER] API error: {response.status}, {response.data[:200]}")
            return get_mock_weather(location)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"[WEATHER] Error fetching weather: {e}")
        import traceback
        print(f"[WEATHER] Traceback: {traceback.format_exc()}")
        return get_mock_weather(location)
```

### Fix 2: Weather Intent Detection in General Agent

**File**: `src/lambda/lambda_whatsapp_kisaanmitra.py`

Added weather keyword detection to `handle_general_query()`:

```python
def handle_general_query(user_message, language='hindi'):
    """Handle general queries - friendly conversation with language support (optimized)"""
    print(f"[DEBUG] ===== GENERAL AGENT =====")
    print(f"[DEBUG] Processing general query: {user_message}, Language: {language}")
    
    # Check if this is a weather query
    message_lower = user_message.lower()
    weather_keywords = ['weather', 'mausam', 'मौसम', 'forecast', 'temperature', 'rain', 'बारिश']
    
    if any(kw in message_lower for kw in weather_keywords) and WEATHER_AVAILABLE:
        print(f"[WEATHER] Weather query detected in general agent")
        
        # Extract city name from message
        import re
        # Try to extract city name after "in", "for", "of", or common city names
        city_match = re.search(r'(?:in|for|of)\s+([a-zA-Z\s]+)', user_message, re.IGNORECASE)
        
        if city_match:
            location = city_match.group(1).strip()
        else:
            # Try to find known city names
            known_cities = list(CITY_TO_STATE.keys())
            location = None
            for city in known_cities:
                if city in message_lower:
                    location = city.title()
                    break
            
            if not location:
                location = "Pune"  # Default
        
        print(f"[WEATHER] Extracted location: {location}")
        
        try:
            weather = get_weather_forecast(location)
            weather_analysis = analyze_weather_for_farming(weather)
            result = format_weather_response(location, weather_analysis)
            
            # Add navigation text
            if INTERACTIVE_MESSAGES_AVAILABLE:
                result = add_navigation_text(result, language)
            
            print(f"[WEATHER] Weather response generated")
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"[WEATHER ERROR] {e}")
            # Fall through to general AI response
    
    # ... rest of general agent logic
```

### Fix 3: Enhanced 7-Day Forecast Display

**File**: `src/lambda/weather_service.py`

Improved `analyze_weather_for_farming()` and `format_weather_response()` to show proper 7-day forecast:

```python
def format_weather_response(location, analysis):
    """Format weather response with 7-day forecast"""
    message = f"🌤️ *Weather Forecast - {location.title()}*\n\n"
    
    # Show 7-day forecast if available
    if analysis.get('daily_forecast'):
        message += "📅 *7-Day Forecast*\n"
        
        weather_emoji = {
            'Clear': '☀️',
            'Clouds': '☁️',
            'Rain': '🌧️',
            'Drizzle': '🌦️',
            'Thunderstorm': '⛈️',
            'Snow': '❄️',
            'Mist': '🌫️',
            'Haze': '🌫️'
        }
        
        for day in analysis['daily_forecast']:
            emoji = weather_emoji.get(day['weather'], '🌤️')
            rain_icon = '💧' if day['rain'] else ''
            message += f"{day['day']}: {emoji} {int(day['min_temp'])}°-{int(day['max_temp'])}°C {rain_icon}\n"
        
        message += "\n"
    
    message += "*🌾 Farming Advice*:\n"
    for rec in analysis['recommendations']:
        message += f"• {rec}\n"
    
    message += "\n💡 *Tip*: Check weather daily for best farming decisions!"
    
    return message
```

3. Automatically shows 7-day forecast for Nashik
4. No need to type anything! ⚡

### Scenario 2: User Clicks Weather Button (WITHOUT Profile Location)
1. User clicks "🌤️ Weather Forecast" from menu
2. System checks profile → No village found
3. System asks: "Which city do you want weather for?"
4. User types: "Nashik"
5. System shows 7-day forecast for Nashik ✅

### Scenario 3: User Types Weather Query Directly
1. User types: "Weather in Nashik"
2. General agent detects weather keywords
3. Extracts city name: "Nashik"
4. Fetches real weather from OpenWeather API
5. Shows 7-day forecast ✅

### Scenario 4: User Types Weather Query Without City
1. User types: "What's the weather?"
2. General agent detects weather keywords
3. No city found → Uses default (Pune)
4. Shows 7-day forecast for Pune ✅
