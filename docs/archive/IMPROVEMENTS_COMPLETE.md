## 3. Smarter Loan Eligibility ✅

### What Changed
Completely revamped `calculate_loan_eligibility()` to provide context-aware, intelligent responses.

### New Features

#### 1. Loan Type Detection
- **Crop Loans**: 100% of cultivation cost, 12-month tenure
- **Equipment Loans**: 85% of cost, 60-month tenure
- **General Agricultural Loans**: 75% of cost, 36-month tenure

#### 2. Smart Interest Rates
- Good credit (>750): Base rate - 1%
- Average credit (650-750): Base rate
- Low/no credit (<650): Base rate + 1.5%
- **Crop loans get 3% government subsidy** (effective 4% interest)

#### 3. Land Size Consideration
- Large farms (≥5 acres): 20% higher loan limit
- Medium farms (2-5 acres): Standard limit
- Small farms (<2 acres): 90% of standard (but eligible for subsidies)

#### 4. Repayment Capacity Assessment
- **Excellent** (DTI < 30%): 95% approval likelihood
- **Good** (DTI 30-40%): 80% approval likelihood
- **Moderate** (DTI 40-50%): 60% approval likelihood
- **Poor** (DTI > 50%): 30% approval likelihood

#### 5. Smart Recommendations
When DTI is high:
- Suggest reducing loan amount by 20-30%
- Recommend using own funds for part of cost
- Suggest applying for subsidies first

Additional recommendations:
- Apply through KCC for 3% subsidy
- Check small farmer subsidies (up to 50%)
- Build credit score tips

#### 6. Alternative Financing
When loan is not feasible:
- Group farming/FPO for shared costs
- Government subsidies (40-60% cost reduction)
- Start with smaller land area

### Example Response

**Before** (Generic):
```
Max Loan: ₹16,000
Interest: 7%
EMI: ₹2,721
Status: approved
```

**After** (Smart):
```

Max Loan: ₹20,000
Interest: 7% (4% effective with subsidy)
Tenure: 12 months
EMI: ₹1,720/month
Repayment Capacity: Excellent
Approval Likelihood: 95%

Recommendations:
💡 Apply through KCC for 3% interest subsidy
💡 Check eligibility for small farmer subsidies

Documents Needed:
• Aadhaar card
• PAN card
• Land records/lease
• Bank statements (6 months)
• Passport size photos
```

## 4. Weather Integration ✅

### What Changed
Integrated real-time weather data into crop recommendations.

### How It Works

1. **Location Detection**
   - Extracts location from user message
   - Falls back to default location (Pune)

2. **Weather Fetching**
   - Uses OpenWeather API (or mock data if API key not set)
   - Gets 3-day forecast

3. **Farming Analysis**
   - Rain prediction (days until rain)
   - Temperature extremes
   - Actionable recommendations

4. **Context Integration**
   - Weather context added to AI prompt
   - AI provides weather-aware advice

### Weather Recommendations

- **Rain coming in 24 hours**: "⚠️ Spray pesticides now before rain!"
- **Extreme heat (>38°C)**: "🌡️ Increase irrigation"
- **Cold (<12°C)**: "❄️ Cover crops to protect from frost"
- **Normal weather**: "✅ Weather is favorable"

### Example Response

**User**: "When should I plant wheat?"

**Response** (with weather):
```
Wheat planting is ideal in October-November. 

🌤️ Weather Forecast - Pune
🌡️ Temperature: 18°C - 28°C
🌧️ Rain: No rain in next 3 days
☀️ Weather is favorable

You can start land preparation now. Ensure soil moisture is adequate before sowing.
```

### Files Modified
- `src/lambda/lambda_whatsapp_kisaanmitra.py` - Added weather integration
- `src/lambda/weather_service.py` - Already existed, now being used

### Note on Weather API
Currently using mock data. To get real weather:
1. Get API key from https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Set environment variable: `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_key`
3. Redeploy Lambda

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Voice Message
1. Send audio/voice message
2. Should receive: "Sorry, I only support text messages and crop images"

### Test 2: Government Schemes
1. Ask: "What government schemes are available?"
2. Should see only real schemes with official websites
3. Verify PM-KISAN, PMFBY, KCC, etc.

### Test 3: Loan Eligibility
1. Ask: "Am I eligible for a loan?"
2. Should get smart response with:
   - Loan type
   - Interest rate with subsidy
   - Repayment capacity
   - Recommendations
   - Documents needed

### Test 4: Weather Integration
1. Ask: "When should I plant tomatoes?"
2. Response should include:
   - Weather forecast
   - Temperature range
   - Rain prediction
   - Weather-based advice
