## Testing

### Test Queries for Hackathon Demo

1. **Total Farmer Count**
   - Query: "How many farmers are in my village"
   - Expected: "Total Farmers in Village: 7" (for Kolhapur)
   - Shows: User profile first, then 6 other farmers

2. **Other Farmers**
   - Query: "Who else grows sugarcane"
   - Expected: List of other farmers growing sugarcane
   - Excludes: Current user from the list

3. **Crop-Specific Queries**
   - Query: "Show me farmers growing tomatoes"
   - Expected: Farmers from villages with tomato cultivation

4. **Village-Specific**
   - Query: "Farmers in Nashik"
   - Expected: 5 farmers from Nashik village

## Verification

### CloudWatch Logs Show:
```
[KG] Loaded 25 farmers from knowledge graph  # Will be 75 after next query
[KG] Searching for village: 'Kolhapur', user_id: '918788868929'
[KG] Found current user: Vinay from Kolhapur
[KG] Found 14 farmers in village 'Kolhapur'  # Will be 6 with new data
[KG] Current user found: True
```

### Expected After Deployment:
```
[KG] Loaded 75 farmers from knowledge graph  ✅
[KG] Searching for village: 'Kolhapur', user_id: '918788868929'
