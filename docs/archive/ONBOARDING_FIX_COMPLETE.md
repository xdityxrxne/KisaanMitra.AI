# Onboarding Fix Complete ✅

## Issue
User Vinay (918788868929) was not triggering onboarding when sending "hi" - system was finding old profile from Feb 28 and routing to main menu instead.

## Root Cause
The onboarding module stores user profiles in **TWO separate tables**:
1. `kisaanmitra-farmer-profiles` - Main profile storage (name, crops, land, village)
2. `kisaanmitra-onboarding` - Onboarding state tracking

Previous cleanup only deleted from `kisaanmitra-conversations` and `kisaanmitra-user-state`, but missed these onboarding-specific tables.

## Solution Applied
Deleted Vinay's data from ALL relevant tables:

### Tables Cleaned:
1. ✅ `kisaanmitra-conversations` - 0 records
2. ✅ `kisaanmitra-farmer-profiles` - Deleted old profile (Feb 28)
3. ✅ `kisaanmitra-onboarding` - Deleted onboarding state
4. ✅ `kisaanmitra-user-state` - Already clean (0 records)
5. ✅ `kisaanmitra-navigation-state` - Deleted navigation state

### Verification Results:
```
1. kisaanmitra-conversations: Count: 0
2. kisaanmitra-farmer-profiles: Count: 0
3. kisaanmitra-onboarding: Count: 0
4. kisaanmitra-user-state: Count: 0
5. kisaanmitra-navigation-state: Count: 0
```

## Next Steps
1. ✅ All data cleared successfully
2. ⏳ User needs to send "hi" again to trigger fresh onboarding
3. ⏳ System should now detect as new user and start onboarding flow

## Commands Used
```bash
# Delete from farmer profiles
aws dynamodb delete-item --table-name kisaanmitra-farmer-profiles \
  --key '{"user_id": {"S": "918788868929"}}' --region ap-south-1

# Delete from onboarding state
aws dynamodb delete-item --table-name kisaanmitra-onboarding \
  --key '{"user_id": {"S": "918788868929"}}' --region ap-south-1

# Delete from navigation state
aws dynamodb delete-item --table-name kisaanmitra-navigation-state \
  --key '{"user_id": {"S": "918788868929"}}' --region ap-south-1
```

## Files Analyzed
- `src/lambda/lambda_whatsapp_kisaanmitra.py` - Main handler
- `src/lambda/user_state_manager.py` - User state management
- `src/onboarding/farmer_onboarding.py` - Onboarding module (found the issue here)

## Key Learning
The onboarding module uses separate tables (`kisaanmitra-farmer-profiles` and `kisaanmitra-onboarding`) that are different from the main state tables. When clearing user data, ALL these tables must be cleaned:
- kisaanmitra-conversations
- kisaanmitra-farmer-profiles ⚠️ (was missed before)
- kisaanmitra-onboarding ⚠️ (was missed before)
- kisaanmitra-user-state
- kisaanmitra-navigation-state ⚠️ (was missed before)

**Status**: Ready for testing - User should send "hi" to trigger onboarding
