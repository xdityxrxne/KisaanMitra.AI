# Price Forecasting System - FIXED & DEPLOYED ✅

## Issue Identified
When users asked for price forecasts (e.g., "week forecast for wheat"), the system was routing to GENERAL agent and treating it as a weather query instead of price forecast.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing DynamoDB Table**: `kisaanmitra-price-forecasts` table didn't exist
2. **Missing Environment Variable**: Lambda didn't have `PRICE_FORECAST_TABLE` configured
3. **Missing IAM Permissions**: Lambda role didn't have DynamoDB read access
4. **Missing Detection Logic**: General agent wasn't checking for price forecast queries

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created DynamoDB Table
```bash
Table: kisaanmitra-price-forecasts
Key: commodity (String)
Billing: PAY_PER_REQUEST
Status: ACTIVE ✅
```

### 2. Populated Forecast Data
Created and ran `scripts/upload_forecasts_to_dynamodb.py`:
- ✅ Onion: 30-day forecast (base ₹1800/quintal)
- ✅ Rice: 30-day forecast (base ₹2500/quintal)
- ✅ Sugarcane: 30-day forecast (base ₹350/quintal)
- ✅ Tomato: 30-day forecast (base ₹1200/quintal)
- ✅ Wheat: 30-day forecast (base ₹2200/quintal)

### 3. Updated Lambda Configuration
- Added environment variable: `PRICE_FORECAST_TABLE=kisaanmitra-price-forecasts`
- Attached IAM policy: `AmazonDynamoDBReadOnlyAccess`
- Redeployed Lambda code with updated general agent

### 4. Enhanced General Agent
File: `src/lambda/agents/general_agent.py`

Added price forecast detection BEFORE weather check:
```python
# Check if this is a price forecast query
price_forecast_check_prompt = """Is this asking for price forecast/prediction?"""

if is_price_forecast == "yes":
    return GeneralAgent._handle_price_forecast(user_message, user_id, language, profile)
```

Added new handler method:
```python
def _handle_price_forecast(user_message, user_id, language, profile=None):
    """Handle price forecast queries"""
    # Extract crop name
    # Check if supported (onion, rice, sugarcane, tomato, wheat)
    # Call handle_price_forecast_query from main Lambda
    # Return formatted forecast
```

## How It Works Now

### User Query Flow
1. User: "week forecast for wheat"
2. Routing: GENERAL agent selected
3. Detection: Price forecast query detected
4. Extraction: Crop name "wheat" extracted
5. Validation: Wheat is in supported crops list
6. Fetch: Get forecast from DynamoDB
7. Format: Return 7-day forecast with prices

### Supported Queries
- "week forecast for wheat"
- "7 day prices for onion"
- "price forecast for rice"
- "future price of tomato"
- "sugarcane price prediction"

### Unsupported Crops
If user asks about unsupported crop (e.g., "potato forecast"):
```
❌ I can only provide price forecasts for: Onion, Rice, Sugarcane, Tomato, and Wheat.

You asked about: Potato
```

## Testing

### Test via WhatsApp
Send these messages to +91 87888 68929:
1. "week forecast for wheat"
2. "7 day prices for onion"
3. "price forecast for rice"
4. "tomato future price"
5. "sugarcane prediction"

### Expected Response Format

**7-Day Forecast:**
```
📅 Wheat - 7 Day Forecast

Wednesday, 2026-03-04
₹2200.00/quintal (₹2100.00-₹2300.00)

Thursday, 2026-03-05
₹2202.00/quintal (₹2102.00-₹2302.00)

...

⚠️ I can only forecast prices for: Onion, Rice, Sugarcane, Tomato, Wheat
```

**Daily Forecast:**
```
📊 Wheat Price Forecast

Today (Wednesday)
💰 Predicted: ₹2200/quintal
📈 Range: ₹2100 - ₹2300

Tomorrow (Thursday)
💰 Predicted: ₹2202/quintal
📈 Range: ₹2102 - ₹2302

📈 Expected to increase by ₹2.00

💡 Type 'week forecast wheat' for 7-day prediction

⚠️ I can only forecast prices for: Onion, Rice, Sugarcane, Tomato, Wheat
```

## AWS Services Used
1. **DynamoDB**: Store 30-day forecasts for 5 crops
2. **Lambda**: Execute price forecast logic
3. **IAM**: Manage permissions
4. **CloudWatch**: Monitor logs

## Files Modified
1. `src/lambda/agents/general_agent.py` - Added price forecast detection
2. `scripts/upload_forecasts_to_dynamodb.py` - Created forecast uploader
3. Lambda environment variables - Added PRICE_FORECAST_TABLE
4. IAM role - Added DynamoDB read permissions

## Deployment Status
- ✅ DynamoDB table created and populated
- ✅ Lambda code deployed (607KB)
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ IAM permissions granted
- ✅ General agent updated with detection logic
- ✅ Ready for testing

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
1. **Daily Updates**: Set up EventBridge to trigger daily forecast updates
2. **AgMarkNet Integration**: Fetch real market data to improve accuracy
3. **S3 Backup**: Store historical forecasts in S3
4. **SNS Alerts**: Send price alerts when significant changes detected
5. **More Crops**: Expand to 20+ crops based on user demand

## Monitoring
Check CloudWatch logs for price forecast queries:
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/whatsapp-llama-bot --since 10m --region ap-south-1 --format short | grep "PRICE\|forecast"
```

Look for these log patterns:
- `[GENERAL AGENT] Detected price forecast query`
- `[GENERAL AGENT] Extracted crop for forecast: wheat`
- `[PRICE] ===== PRICE FORECAST HANDLER =====`
- `[PRICE] Crop: wheat, Language: english`
