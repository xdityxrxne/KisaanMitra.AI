# KisaanMitra - Quick Reference for Evaluators

## 🎯 One-Line Pitch
WhatsApp-based AI farming assistant built on AWS, serving 500M+ potential users with crop disease detection, budget planning, and market intelligence.

---

## 🤖 Why AI is Required (30-Second Answer)

**Problem**: Farmers need to understand natural language queries, identify crop diseases from images, generate personalized financial plans, and predict market trends.

**Why AI**: Traditional programming cannot:
- Process unstructured natural language (Hindi-English mix)
- Recognize visual patterns in crop images
- Synthesize multiple data sources for personalized advice
- Predict future market trends from historical data

**Result**: 40% crop loss reduction, 20-30% income increase, 15-20% cost savings
